# Genius Analysis of French singers

This project's aim is to analyse the lyrics of french singers. For a given artist, the program returns a pdf with the analysis album by album of the most frequent words within all the songs.

It will return the album cover + a cloud of words + a chart with the most frequent words. 

You just have to create an API KEY on https://genius.com/api-clients

Also go on the artist's page on Genius and find out how it is written.

Copy your api Key and the artist's name in the code and run all the cells. 

It will take around 5min to scrape everything, analyse it and generate the pdf.
